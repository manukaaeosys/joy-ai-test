## Mistral AI

[Mistral AI](https://mistral.ai/) is an innovative platform focused on revolutionizing the field of generative AI, particularly large language models (LLMs). Their approach is centered around developing and providing open-source AI models, which stands in contrast to proprietary AI solutions. This strategy aligns with their belief in the power of community-driven development and the importance of open science.

Their first major offering, Mistral 7B, is a testament to their commitment to this philosophy. It's a 7 billion parameter model released under the Apache 2.0 license, allowing unrestricted use. Mistral 7B has been designed to outperform other open models up to 13 billion parameters in standard English and code benchmarks. This model is notable for its ability to handle tasks like summarization, structuration, and question answering efficiently and cost-effectively compared to larger proprietary solutions.
