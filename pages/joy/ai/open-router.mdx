## Open Router

[Open Router](https://openrouter.ai/), accessible at openrouter.ai, is a relatively new service that provides users with access to various Large Language Models (LLMs) that are typically not readily available. This includes prominent models like GPT-4 32K, Google PaLM, Anthropic, and others. Open Router operates by allowing users to create an account and generate an API key, which then enables them to integrate these models into their applications or platforms.

The service offers some models for free, and users have the option to purchase credits for accessing premium models. This flexible approach makes Open Router an attractive option for individuals and organizations looking to leverage advanced AI capabilities without the constraints of sticking to a single provider or model.
