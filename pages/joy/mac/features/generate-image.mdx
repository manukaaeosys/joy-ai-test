Joy has the capability to generate images using DALL-E, an AI-driven image creation tool. Images created in Joy are stored locally on the user's device, ensuring they do not expire and remain accessible. Additionally, Joy offers a feature for users to download these images for their use. 

There's also an image history viewing option, allowing users to revisit and manage their previously generated images, enhancing the overall usability and experience of the app in handling AI-generated visual content.
