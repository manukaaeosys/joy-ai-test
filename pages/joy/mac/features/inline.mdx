Joy's inline mode feature allows users to define a specific phrase which, when typed in any app, activates Joy to start answering questions directly within that app. This seamless integration means users can generate ideas and content efficiently without needing to switch contexts or leave their current application. 

It's an effective tool for enhancing productivity and creative flow.

## How to 

- Go to **Settings** -> **Features** section -> **Inline Mode**
- Enable and define a **Trigger Phrase**
- You may need to enable Accessibility permission for Joy for it to send input signal
