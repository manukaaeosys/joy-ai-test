## Quick Start

Joy is available in both AppStore and Standalone version

## Unlock Lifetime

When you start Joy, subscribing is the simplest way to access all the features right away. It's like getting a pass to enjoy everything the app has to offer without any extra steps.

But if you have your own API key and want to take charge of your Joy experience, you have the option to unlock that capability.

A Lifetime membership in Joy means you get to use all of Joy's cool features with your very own API key. This gives you complete control over how you use Joy.

You can grab your API key from [OpenAI API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

For AppStore version, on iPhone and iPad. Note that you can restore purchase on other devices.

- Go to Joy Settings
- Select Advanced section
- Tap to edit API Key
- Unlock to enjoy Joy with your own API key.
